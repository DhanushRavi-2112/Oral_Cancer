- Biopsy confirmation for positive cases
- Inter-annotator agreement metrics
- Detailed lesion boundaries (if applicable)
```

## 8. Combining Multiple Sources

### 8.1 Dataset Integration Strategy
1. Standardize image formats and sizes
2. Harmonize annotation schemes
3. Balance class distributions
4. Remove duplicates and low-quality images
5. Create unified metadata format

### 8.2 Data Split Considerations
- Ensure each split has images from multiple sources
- Maintain demographic diversity
- Account for imaging device variations

## 9. Legal and Compliance

### 9.1 Requirements
